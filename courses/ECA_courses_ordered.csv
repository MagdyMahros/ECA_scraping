The values, conceptual lenses and assumptions of liberation and wellbeing are developed as being appropriate for an emerging Community Counselling model. Fundamental to the theory and practice of the emerging field is the recognition of significant social injustice. The meaning of a range of concepts such as power, solidarity, collaboration, accountability and partnering are explored and evaluated in the context of personal, relational and social wellbeing with a focus on ecosystemic thinking. Issues and concerns are investigated at different levels of conceptionalisation.
